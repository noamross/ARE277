# Problem 1

Consider a simple economy whose welfare $W$ in period $t$ depends on the consumption of a single (composite) commodity $(q(t))$ and the stock of atmospheric carbon concentration $(X(t)$ that is produced jointly with the commodity.  The problem confronting our simple economy is:

$$\max_{q(t)} \int_0^\infty e^{-\delta t} W(q,X,t)\, dt$$

$$\text{s.t. }\, \frac{dX}{dt} = f(q,X,t), \, X(0)$$ 

where $W(q,X,t)$ is the welfare function, $f(q,X,t)$ describes the accumulation of atmospheric carbon concentration over time, and $\delta$ is the discount rate.  $W$ and $f$ have the following functional forms:

$$W(q,X,t) = B(q_t) - D(X_t) = q_t^a - \frac{c}{2}X_t^2$$

$$f(q,X,t) = -\beta X_t  + \alpha q_t$$

Where $\beta, \alpha$ and $c$ are positive and $0 < a < 1$.

## (a) ##

*Draw a phase diagram in $[-\phi, X]$ space, where $(-\phi)$ is the price of pollution.*

The current-value Hamiltonian for this maximization problem is:

$$\mathcal H = q_t^a - \frac{c}{2} X^2_t + \phi(-\beta X_t + \alpha q_t)$$

From this I solve for the optimal paths of $X_t$ and $-\phi_t$:

$$\mathcal H_q = 0 = aq_t^{\alpha-1} + \phi \alpha$$

$$\dot X = -\beta X_t + \alpha q_t$$

$$\dot X = -\beta X_t + \alpha \left(\frac{(-\phi) \alpha}{a} \right)^{\frac{1}{a-1}} \tag{1}$$

$$\dot \phi = -\mathcal H_X + \phi \delta = cX_t + \phi(\beta + \delta)$$

$$(-\dot \phi) = -cX_t + (-\phi)(\beta + \delta) \tag{2}$$

Equations (1) and (2) define our phase plane.  Setting $\dot X_t$ and $- \dot\phi_t$ equal to zero I find the nullclines:

$$\dot X = 0 \Rightarrow -\phi = \frac{a}{\alpha} \left(\frac{\beta}{\alpha} X \right)^{a-1}$$

$$- \dot \phi = 0 \Rightarrow -\phi =   \frac{c}{\beta + \delta} X$$ 

I draw these nullclines on a phase diagram and add arrows to indicate the dynamics:

![Phase-plane in damage-pollution space stock for the climate change model](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/ARE277FinalFig1.png)

I note that, since equation the $\dot X=0$ nullcline includes a fractional exponent, it has infinite slope at the origin and thus the slope of $-\dot \phi = 0$ will never exceed it.  Thus this is the only configuration of this phase plane for these functional forms.

It appears from the diagram that the equilibrium is a saddle node.  I confirm by examining the Jacobian matrix:

$$\boldsymbol J = \begin{bmatrix} -\beta & \frac{\alpha}{a-1} \left( \frac{\alpha}{a} \right)^{\frac{1}{a-1}} (-\phi)^{ \frac{2-a}{a-1}}     \\ -c & \beta + \delta  \end{bmatrix}$$

$\text{tr}(\boldsymbol J) = \delta$ and $\det(\boldsymbol J) < 0$ for all allowed parameter value, so the equilibrium is a stable node.

## (b) ##

*Assume $X_0$ is below the long-run steady state and interpret your results in the context of the "policy-ramp" vs. "big bang" debate*

The debate desribed by Krugman comes down to different views on our current position within models similar to the one described above.  Assuming an infinite time horizon, the policy goal should be to get the economy to or near the equilibrium point, where the atmospheric carbon stock is constant due to a balance between emissions driven by commodity production and uptake by the biosphere.  Our ability to reach this point, however, depends on our current level of economic activity $(q_t)$.  

Along optimal paths, the shadow cost of pollution has an inverse relationship the commodity production

$$-\phi = \frac{a}{\alpha} q^{a-1}, (0 < a < 1)$$ 

so high values of $(-\phi)$ on the diagram below correspond to low commodity production.

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/ARE277FinalFig2.png)

With $X_0$ below the equilibrium, paths of approach to the equilibrium are divided by a saddle path.  For $(-\phi)_0$ above this saddle path (I in the figure), current commodity production is low, and the optimal path initially maintains similar levels of production, with increasing carbon pollution.  As the path approaches the equilibrium $-\phi$ increases, meaning that commodity production is reduced, and carbon pollution accumulation slows.  This is the "policy-ramp" case, where reduction in production are put off to the future.

If $(-\phi)$ is below the saddle path (II), the optimal approach is to start by increasing $(-\phi)$, and thus reducing economic activity, at the start of the path, and continue doing so, albeit at a decreasing rate, as the equilibrium is approached.  This is the "big bang" case, where immediate reductions in production are required.

## (c) ##

*Using the phase diagram, illustrate the implications of the following statements*

### (i) ###

*"Stern, in particular argues that policy makers should give the same weight to future generations' welfare as we give to those now living."*

Stern's argument can be represented by using a very low or zero discount rate $\delta$.   Since this $(-\phi)$ nullcline has a slope of $\frac{c}{\beta + \delta }$, this has the effect of increasing its slope:

The consenquences of this shift are that (a) at equilibrium, the best policy is to have lower carbon pollution, less commodity output, and thus higher $(-\phi)$, and (b) our current levels of commodity production are more likely to fall below the saddle path, and therefore require a "big-bang" style policy response.

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/ARE277FinalFig3.png)

### (ii) ###

*"Moreover, the proponents of fast action hold that the damage from emissions may be much larger than policy-ramp analyses suggest, either because global temperatures are more sensitive to greenhouse-gas emissions that previously thought or because the economic damage from a large rise in temperatures is much greater than the guesstimates in the climate-ramp models."*

Both mechanisms described here can be represented as increases in $c$, the parameter for the welfare reduction due to increased carbon stocks.  An increase in $c$ would have the effect of a greater slope on the  $(-\phi)$ nullcline, as in (ii) above, with the same effects.  Greater sensitivity of the climate system could also be due to smaller values of $\beta$, the natural rate of carbon reduction in the atmosphere.  This would also increase the slope of the $(-\phi)$ nullcline, as well as pulling the $\dot X$ nullcline outwards, as shown below:

The consequences of a greater atmospheric sensitivity are similar to those of greater welfare impact of increased temperature - they require lower ultimate atmospheric carbon, less commodity production and lower $(-\phi)$, and make a "big bang" policy optimal for even lower levels of initial commodity output.

# Problem 2 #

Demand for wine increases with age according to the function:

$$D_t = A_t p^{\alpha-1}, \, 0 < \alpha < 1$$

Where $A_t$ is the aging profile of the wine, at $p_t$ is price.  Revenue from wine sales is $p_t D_t$, and the initial quantity of wine from bottling is $x_0$.  Inventory of wine declines according to demand:

$$\dot x = - D_t = -A_t p^{\alpha-1}$$

Marginal cost of holding inventory is a constant, $c$.  Assume that a vineyard sells wine over a period $T$, with no wine lieft at the end of the period, and that we know function describing the aging profile of the wine.

## (i) ##

*Set-up the optimal control problem for determining the optimal pricing path where $T$ is to be chosen optimally and the objective is to maximize the present discounted returns from selling the wine less the total costs of holding inventory over time.*

$$\max_{p_t} \int_0^T e^{-\delta t} (p_t D_t - c) \, dt = \max_{p_t} \int_0^T e^{-\delta t} (A_t p_t^\alpha - c) \, dt$$

$$\text{s.t. }\, \dot x = -D_t = -A_t p^{\alpha-1}$$

$$x(0) = x_0, x(T) = 0$$

$$ T = T^*$$

## (ii) ##

*Determine the optimal pricing strategy.  Discuss the transversality condition*

The Hamiltonian for the problem is

$$\mathcal H = A_t p_t^\alpha - c - \lambda A_t p_t^{\alpha -1}$$

From this I solve for $p_t$:

$$\mathcal H_p = 0 = \alpha A_t p_t^{\alpha -1} - \lambda_t (\alpha -1) A_t p_t^{\alpha-2}$$

$$p_t = \frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha} \lambda_t$$

$$\dot \lambda = - \mathcal H_x + \delta \lambda_t = \delta \lambda_t$$

$$\lambda_t = \lambda_0 e^{\delta t}$$

$$p_t = \frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha} \lambda_0 e^{\delta t} = p_0 e^{\delta t}$$

The optimal pricing strategy is to raise prices at the rate of interest.  

The initial price $p_0$ and the sales period $T$ are determined by the transversality condition $\mathcal H(T) = 0$ and the requirement that $x(T) = 0$:

$$ \mathcal H = 0 = A_T p_T^\alpha - c - \lambda_T A_T p_T^{\alpha -1}$$

$$\begin{aligned} 
   c &= A_T (p_T^\alpha - \lambda p_T^{\alpha -1})\\
   &= A_T \left(p_T^\alpha - p_T \left( \frac{\alpha}{\alpha -1} \right)  p_T^{\alpha -1}\right)\\
   &= A_T p_T^\alpha \left(1 - \left( \frac{\alpha}{\alpha -1} \right) \right) \\
   & = \left( \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \right) A_T p_T^\alpha \\
  \end{aligned}$$
  
$$ c = \left( \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \right) A_T p_0^\alpha e^{\alpha \delta T}$$

$$ p_0 = \left(\frac{(1-\alpha)c e^{-\alpha \delta T}}{A_T}\right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}$$


$$x_0 = \int_0^T A_t p_t^{\alpha -1}\, dt = \int_0^T A_t p_0^{\alpha - 1} e^{-\delta (1-\alpha) t} \, dt$$

If we assume that $A_t$ is constant at $A_c$, then

$$x_0 = A_c p_0^{\alpha-1} \int_0^T e^{-\delta (1-\alpha) t} \, dt$$

$$x_0 = -\frac{A_c p_0^{\alpha-1}}{\delta (1-\alpha)} \left[e^{-\delta (1-\alpha) T}  - 1\right] $$

$$x_0 = -\frac{A_c p_0^{\alpha-1}}{\delta (1-\alpha)} \left[e^{-\delta (1-\alpha) T}  - 1\right] $$

$$p_0 = \left[\frac{A_c }{x_0 \delta (1-\alpha)} \left[1 - e^{-\delta (1-\alpha) T} \right]\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}  $$

While $p_0$ and $T$ depend on the exact form of $A_T$, in general, the transversality conditions point to 



## (iii) ##

*From what you determined about the optimal price path, what does the optimal sales path look like?*

The sales path is equal to the demand path:

$$ S_t = D_t =  A_t p^{\alpha-1} = p_0^{\alpha-1} A_t e^{-\delta (1-\alpha) t}$$

Thus sales follow a path that is proportional to the aging profile of the wine times exponential decay determined by the rate of interest $\delta$ and the consumer price elasticity parameter $\alpha$.  If the profile of the wine were constant, sales would decay over time.  If the wine improves with age, sales would decay over time unless it improved at a rate greater than $\delta(1-\alpha)$, in which case sales would grow.  If the wine's profile was humped, with a peak in quality, sales might rise at first, but sales would peak prior to the peak in the wine's profile (when the slope of $A_t$ fell below $\delta(1-\alpha)$), and sales would then decline rapidly.

## (iv) ##

*What factors explain why some wineries release most of their wines early at a young age whereas others hold on to them as they age and spread the sales out?*

Wineries' schedule for releasing wines depends on both their wines' aging profile $(A_t)$ and the price sensitivity of their customers $(\alpha)$.  If wine, due to increasing quality from aging, the potential sales of a batch of wine grow faster than the discount rate, then it pays not to sell the wine until its quality stops rising as quickly.  

The discount rate $\delta$ should not matter as long as wineries are in an economy with a common rate of interest. 


# Problem 3 #


## (i) ##

I maximize the negative damages minus the costs, discounting for time:

$$\max_{R_t} \int_0^T e^{-rt}[-D(S_t) - C(R_t)] \, dt= \max_{R_t} \int_0^T e^{-rt}(-aS_t- \frac{1}{2} c R_t^2 )\, dt$$

$$\text{s.t. }\, \dot S = -\delta S_t - R_t$$

$$S(0) = S_0, S(T) = 0, T=T$$

## (ii) ##

I solve for $R_t$ using the Hamiltonian, the maximum principle and the adjunct equation:

$$\mathcal H = -aS - \frac{1}{2} c R^2 + \lambda(-\delta S - R)$$

$$\mathcal H_R = 0 = -cR - \lambda$$

$$\lambda = -cR, \dot \lambda = -c \dot R$$

$$\dot \lambda = -\mathcal H_S + r\lambda = a + \lambda (r + \delta)$$

$$-c \dot R = a + (-cR)(r+\delta)$$

$$\dot R = -\frac{a}{c} + R(r + \delta)$$

$$ \int \frac{dR}{(r+\delta) R - \frac{a}{c} } = \int dt$$

$$ \frac{1}{r+\delta} \ln \lvert  (r+\delta) R - \frac{a}{c} \rvert = t + C $$

$$ R_t = Ce^{t(r+\delta)} + \frac{a}{c(r+\delta)}$$

To determine $C$, I use the condition $S(T) = 0$. This requires solving for $S_t$, using an integrating factor:

$$\frac{dS}{dt} + \delta S = -R_t$$

$$e^{\delta t}\frac{dS}{dt} + e^{\delta t} \delta S = -e^{\delta t} R_t$$

$$ \frac{d}{dt}  e^{\delta t} S = - e^{\delta t} R_t$$

$$S = - e^{-\delta t} \int e^{\delta t} R_t \, dt$$

$$S_T = 0 = S_0 - e^{-\delta T} \int_0^T e^{\delta t} R_t \, dt$$

$$\begin{aligned} 
   S_0 &= e^{-\delta T} \int_0^T e^{\delta t} R_t \, dt \\
   &= e^{-\delta T} \int_0^T Ce^{(r+2\delta)t} + \frac{a}{c(r+\delta)} e^{\delta t} \, dt \\
   &= e^{-\delta T} \left[ \frac{C}{r+2\delta} e^{(r+2\delta)t} + \frac{a}{\delta c (r+\delta)} e^{\delta t} \right]_0^T \\
   &= e^{-\delta T} \left[ \frac{C}{r+2\delta} (e^{(r+2\delta)T} - 1) + \frac{a}{\delta c (r+\delta)} (e^{\delta T} -1) \right] \\
   &=  \frac{C}{r+2\delta} (e^{(r+\delta) T} - e^{-\delta T}) + \frac{a}{\delta c (r+\delta)}(1- e^{-\delta T}) \\
  \end{aligned}$$
  
$$ C = \left[ S_0 - \frac{a}{\delta c (r + \delta)} \left(1 - e^{-\delta T} \right) \right] \frac{r+ 2 \delta}{e^{(r + \delta)T} - e^{-\delta T}}$$
  
## (iii) ##

The optimal path of removal increases at the combined rates of interest and chemical degradation $(r + \delta)$ (See path I in (iv)).  This reflects that cleanup costs are lower in the future, but that the chemicals must be removed by time $T$.  There is an additional contribution to removal $a/(c+(r+\delta)$ that reflects the need to reduce current and future damages.

An increase in either the interest rate (path II on figure in (iv)) degradation rate tilts cleanup to the future, because of a reduced need to avoid current and future damages, and a greater preference to shift cleanup costs to the future when costs are discounted and the amount of pollution to clean is less.  A decrease in these values, though, means that the damages from the pollution will be greater and even future costs will be significant, so this tilts cleanup to the present (III).

Increased damages $(a)$ shift the overall cleanup path higher and tilt cleanup to the present, because of the need to avoid damages throughout the period.  Increased costs $(c)$ of cleanup, however, have the opposite effect. (V)

The initial rate of cleanup $(C + a/(c+(r+\delta))$ increases with the initial pollution stock $S_0$, because of the need to get rid of all of the chemical (IV).  Changes in the time period $T$ have a complex effect that depends on other parameters.  If the damages from chemicals are high or cleanup costs low (large $a$, small $c$), longer time periods will drive higher initial cleanup rates, because of the potential damage that occur over such a long period.   On the other hand, if damages are not large or costs are high, a long time period will result in low initial cleanup rates, because it is preferable to push cleanup as far towards the end of the time period as possible.

## (iv) ##

The phase plane is characterized with the equations:

$$\dot R = -\frac{a}{c} + R(r + \delta)$$

$$\dot S = -\delta S - R$$

The nullclines are:

$$\dot R = 0 \Rightarrow  R = \frac{a}{c(r + \delta)} $$

$$\dot S = 0 \Rightarrow R = -\delta S$$ 

I draw these on the phase plane and add the paths described in (iii) above:

![](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3356641/blogstuff/ARE277FinalFig5.png)

## (v) ##

It would be optimal to not fully clean up the site if the cost of cleanup exceeded the damages incurred during the period $T$.  This might occur if an owner occupied a site for a limited period of time, and was able to sell the property without revealing the presence of the chemicals or otherwise accepting liability for their presence.  In this the problem would use the same maximization problem, with a fixed period $T$.  Rather than constrain it with $x(T) = 0$, though, I would use the transversality condition $\lambda(T) = 0$.  This represents zero remaining shadow costs of the pollution left in the ground:

$$\lambda(T) = 0 = -Cce^T(r+\delta) - \frac{a}{r+\delta}$$ 

$$C = -\frac{a}{c(r+\delta)} e^{-T(r+\delta)}$$
  
   

# Problem 4

## (1)

$$\max_{I_t, E_t} \int_0^T e^{-rt} \left[p_t y(E_t, K_t, W_t) - C_1(I_t) - C_2(E_t)\right] \, dt$$

$$y = \ln (qE_t W_t K_t)$$

$$C_1(I_t) = c_1 I_t + \frac{d_1}{2} I_t^2$$

$$C_2(E_t) = c_2 E_t + \frac{d_2}{2} E_t^2$$ 

$$\text{s.t. } \begin{cases} \dot K = I_t - \delta K_t \\ \dot W = F_t - qE_t W_t - \phi W_t \end{cases}$$

$$\mathcal H = p_t \ln(qE_t W_t K_t) -  c_1 I_t - \frac{d_1}{2} I_t^2 - c_2 E_t - \frac{d_2}{2} E_t^2 + \lambda_t( I_t - \delta K_t) + \mu_t (F_t - qE_t W_t - \phi W_t )$$

$$\mathcal H_I = 0 = -c_1 - d_1 I + \lambda_t$$

$$\mathcal H_E = 0 = \frac{p_t}{E_t} - c_2 - d_2 E - q \mu_t W_t \tag{1}$$

$$\dot \lambda = -\mathcal H_K + r\lambda_t = -\frac{p_t}{K_t} + \lambda_t(\delta + r)$$

$$\dot \mu = -\mathcal H_W + r\mu_t = -\frac{p_t}{W_t} + \mu_t (q E_t + \phi + r)  \tag{2}$$

$$\lambda_t = c_1 + d_1 I_t, \dot \lambda = d_1 \dot I$$

$$d_1 \dot I = -\frac{p_t}{K_t} + (c_1 + d_1 I_t)(\delta + r)$$

$$\dot I = - \frac{p_t}{d_1} \frac{1}{K_t}  + \left(\frac{c_1}{d_1} + I_t \right) (\delta + r)$$  

Rather than solve explicitly for $\dot E$, I set up the problem with the differential equations for $\dot K, \dot I, \dot W$, and $\dot \mu$, solving equation (1) above to determine E for each time step.

```

## (2)

*What are steady-state levels of $I, K, W$, and $E$?*

Using a solver, I find the steady-states of the system under constant price and recharge rates:

```{r steady}
p.t <- function(t=0) {P}
f.t <- function(t=0) {f}

ss <- steady(c(K=10,I=1, W=2, E=2), time=0, farmeqs, parms=Pars)
ss$y
ss[[2]]
```
The steady state values are $K_{ss} = `r I(ss$y["K"])`$, $I_{ss} = `r I(ss$y["I"])`$, $W_{ss} = `r I(ss$y["W"])`$ and $E_{ss} = `r I(ss$y["E"])`$

## (3)

I use the previous results to set the boundary conditions for the problem.  I derive another boundary condition from $\lambda(T)=0$, assuming that farming ends at the end of the water lease. This yields $I(T) = -\frac{c_1}{d_1}$.   

```{r}
K.0 <- ss$y["K"]/2; names(K.0) <- NULL
W.0 <- ss$y["W"]/2; names(W.0) <- NULL
W.T <- ss$y["W"]*0.85; names(W.T) <-NULL
I.T <- -c_1/d_1
```
```{r test}
times <- seq(0,T.f,1)
ode(y=c(ss$y["K"], ss$y["I"], ss$y["W"], ss$y["E"]), times=times, parms=Pars,func=farmeqs)
```

Now I used `bvpcol` to solve this boundary point problem:

```{r bvp1}
bvptwp(yini = c(K=K.0, I=NA, W=W.0, E=NA), x=times, func=farmeqs, yend = c(K=NA, I=I.T, W=W.T, E=NA), parms=Pars, guess = c(I=1,E=0.5))
```

## (4)

```{r Ts}
T.f <- 25
bvpcol(yini = c(K.0, I=NA, W.0, u=NA), x=times, func=farmeqs, yend = c(K=NA, I=I.T, W.T, u=NA), parms=Pars)
T.f <- 100
bvpcol(yini = c(K.0, I=NA, W.0, u=NA), x=times, func=farmeqs, yend = c(K=NA, I=I.T, W.T, u=NA), parms=Pars)
```

## (5)

The transversality condition $\mu = 0$ sets the optimal path when the amount of water in the reservoir at the end of the lease is a free variable

```{r leave}
T.f <- 50
bvpcol(yini = c(K.0, I=NA, W.0, u=NA), x=times, func=farmeqs, yend = c(K=NA, I=I.T, W=NA, u=0), parms=Pars)

```

```{r varying-price}
